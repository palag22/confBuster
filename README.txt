ConfBuster - Open source tools for macrocycles conformational search and analysishttps://github.com/patricklague/ConfBuster## Dependencies ##CORE- Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org)- NetworkX (tested with 1.11) (https://networkx.github.io)- Pymol (≥ 1.8) (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pymol)- Open Babel (≥ 2.4.1) (http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page)  The version of Open Babel should imperatively be 2.4.1.  As indicated in the instruction, Eigen version 2 is requiered to use properly Open Babel (https://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Installation/install.html).  Link to download: https://sourceforge.net/projects/openbabel/files/  For a clean and functional installation:  In openbabel-2.4.1 directory:  $ mkdir build  $ cd build  $ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/where/you/want  $ make -j4  $ make install  (This is essential for Open Babel to work properly)OPTIONAL (VISUALIZATION)- R (≥ 3.0.0) (https://cran.r-project.org/index.html)- R package ComplexHeatmap (≥ 1.14) (from Bioconductor release 3.5 (bioconductor.org))  R shell:  source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")  biocLite("ComplexHeatmap")- R package circlize (≥ 0.4.0)  R shell:  install.packages("circlize")## Installation ##The most simple way to install ConfBuster is by downloading the official release in the GitHub section “release”. Alternatively, one may clone the ConfBuster repository using git :$ git clone https://github.com/patricklague/ConfBuster.gitAt your choice, put the scripts in a directory present in your $PATH OR add the directory where the scripts are to your $PATH:export PATH=$PATH:/full-path-here/ConfBuster/PyMOL and Open Babel should also be included in your $PATH. If you want to install them locally, you should change the headers of the ConfBuster scripts to add their correct absolute paths.##ConfBuster tools ##- ConfBuster-Single-Molecule-Minimization  Performs a simple minimization of the given molecule (recommended before).- ConfBuster-Macrocycle-Linear-Sampling  Performs a conformational search of a cyclic molecule.  - ConfBuster-Rotamer-Search  Identify rotational isomers of a molecule.  - ConfBuster-Analysis  Perform post-analyses to visualize a clustering based on RMSD values between the conformations.  ## Tutorial ##A complete step-by-step tutorial is available on the ConfBuster GitHub (https://github.com/patricklague/ConfBuster).## How to cite ##Barbeau, X., Vincent, A.T. & Lagüe, P., (2018).
